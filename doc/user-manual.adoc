= FIFO Queue Connector

A connector which provides FIFO queues which internally uses the Mule Object Store to store the data. Hence, if the object store is persistent and the application is interrupted, the data will reappear on the queue once it is restarted.

== Introduction 

Why use another FIFO queue when Mule provides the VM connector out of the box? The VM connector works brilliantly well, but it does not retain its FIFO feature when used on CloudHub with persistency turned on.

Some use cases need to processed in order, such as processing update messages. Otherwise an older update might overwrite a newer update. If the flow is asynchronous and message loss is not acceptable, this cannot be achieved on CloudHub unless some external transport is used.

=== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/35X/Anypoint+Connectors[Anypoint™ Connectors], and the http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/35X/Anypoint+Studio+Essentials[Anypoint™ Studio interface]. To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing one or more http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/35X/Basic+Studio+Tutorial[Anypoint™ Studio Tutorials]. Further, this page assumes that you have a basic understanding of http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Mule+Concepts[Mule flows] and http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Global+Elements[Mule Global Elements]. 

=== Requirements

=== Configuring

To use the FIFO Queue connector, you must configure:

* A global FIFO Queue element for use by all the FIFO Queue connectors in an application.
- _Anypoint™ Studio Visual Editor_
. Click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the canvas, then click *Create*.
. In the *Choose Global Type* menu, use the filter to locate and select *FIFO Queue*, then click *OK*.
. Configure the parameters according to the table below.
+
|===
|Parameter 						|Description

|*Name*							|Enter a name for the configuration so it can be referenced later.
|*Object Store Reference*		|Enter the object store used to store the queue messages.
|===
+

- _Anypoint™ Studio XML Editor_
+
Create a global FIFO Queue configuration outside and above your flows, using the following global configuration code. Ensure that you include the FIFO Queue namespaces in your configuration file.
